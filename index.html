    <p style="color: #aa1c7e;"> Fist off, we don't speak your language. We speak Robotinese! it's very complicated to learn. (please don't ask me to teach it to you. You must be introduced to it at birth. so unless you're a baby,please don't ask me. and from my observations, babies can't read.) There are many "icorns" in the roboticorn culture. caticorn, narwal (doesn't have "icorn" in it, but it's an aception), unicorn and pandicorn. my faveorite personally is caticorn. Don't tell my friends that! I am just a narwal. But my friends are:
