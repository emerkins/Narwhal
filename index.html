    <p style="color: #6f6fff;">Fist off, we don't speak your language. We speak Robotinese! it's very complicated to learn 
    (please don't ask me to teach it to you). There are many "icorns" in the roboticorn culture. caticorn, narwal, unicorn and 
    pandicorn. my faveorite personally is caticorn. Don't tell my friends that! I am just a narwal. But my friends are Crafticons 
    (aka: Aloe), Caticorns (aka: Claire), Fluffycorn (aka: Abu), and Hamicorn (aka: Belo). 
    </p>
    
    <p style="color: #6f6fff;"> Well, enough about roboticonrs and more about me! This is titled "Meet Biji" 
    <strong style="color:#ea6aea">DDDDDUUUUUHHHHH</strong>. So! Let's come up with questions</p>
